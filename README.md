# P_1_HS_CALC
My first program made as a study project from JetBrains Academy. It's a simple +, -, /, * calculator.
It's a little bit rough, but I plan to improve myself over the next projects instead of upgrading this one,
so I can actually see the difference and the improvement of my coding skills.
